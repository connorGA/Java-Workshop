 class Main {         // defines class 'Main'
    void main() {    // method = function that belongs to a class
        //main
    }
}

// In Java, classes and methods should have an "access modifier". 
// An access modifier is a special keyword that determines if other classes and methods can access those classes/methods
// Example: public, private, etc.

public class Basics {   // NOTE: the public type must be defined in its own file. So this works because the file and class are both called 'Basics'
    public void main() {
        //main
    }
}
